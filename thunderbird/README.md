# Thunderbird Backup

I don't believe this backup method saves any secret or protected data, but because you never know I gpg encrypt it anyway.

## Files
- profile.tar.xz.gpg: The (encrypted) archive of a skeleton of a thunderbird configuration.
- profile.ini: A thunderbird specific file for pointing to the 'correct' thunderbird profile
- backup.sh: A tool for backing up this aforementioned configuration
