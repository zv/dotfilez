# By default GnuPG creates version 4 signatures for data files as

# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross

# translation.  Note that future version of GnuPG will change to UTF-8
